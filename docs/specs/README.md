# Scene-First UI Specs (Monet Pixel-Art)

This folder contains implementation-ready specifications for the scene-first redesign. It is optimized for Codex implementation without additional design back-and-forth.

- theme-motion-spec.md — Moment palettes, text halos, motion, layering, chart tokens
- layout-rules-spec.md — Scene-aware layout, safe zones, reflow heuristics, courtesy fade
- copy-spec.md — Microcopy for data, insights, tooltips, callouts
- pixel-sprite-prompts.md — One-shot prompts and asset list for new/optional sprites

All specs assume: no opaque surfaces over the scene; legibility via halos/shadows only; no performance/accessibility constraints.
