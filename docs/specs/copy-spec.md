# Copy Spec (Microcopy & Structure)

Tone: concise, warm, painterly. No jargon; one-liners preferred. Scene-first: copy should not demand large blocks.

## Labels (Primary Metrics)

- HRV → “HRV” (ms)
- Resting HR → “Resting HR” (bpm)
- Sleep → “Sleep” (hrs)
- Training Load (14d) → “Load (14d)” (pts)

## Readiness (Hero)

- Score (out of 100): Numeric only (no suffix). Underneath: “/ 100” and label.
- Label (fallback): “Awaiting insight”
- One-line intro (examples):
  - Morning: “Poised for a bright start.”
  - Noon: “Steady energy through the day.”
  - Twilight: “Ease into the calm.”
  - Night: “Restore and settle.”

## Metric Rows (Each becomes micro‑cards)

- Left micro‑card (Name + Value + Delta)
  - Title format: “NAME: VALUE UNIT” (e.g., “HRV: 62 ms”)
  - Below: “8.4 / 10” (score)
  - Below: delta label — examples:
    - “+12 vs 7‑day avg”
    - “−3 bpm vs last week”
    - “+0.4 hrs vs usual”

- Right micro‑card (Insight, 1–2 lines max)
  - HRV: “Recovery signals trending strong.”
  - RHR: “Resting rate holds steady.”
  - Sleep: “Deep sleep carried the night.”
  - Load: “Training load within sweet spot.”

- Third micro‑card (Sparkline)
  - Label-free. Tooltip shows value + delta when hovered.

## Tooltips (Charts)

- Title: Metric + date (e.g., “HRV — Tue”)
- Value line: “62 ms ( +12 vs 7‑day avg )”
- Keep single-line where possible; wrap at 24–28ch.

## Scene Callouts (Optional, 1‑liners)

- Bridge tag: “Balance, graceful as an arch.”
- Boat tag: “Drifting: focus and flow.”
- Horizon tag: “Light skims the water.”

## Empty / Loading

- “Gathering the water’s reflections…”
- “Bringing the lilies into view…”
